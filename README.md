# Little package to help with adding Open Graph information to a page

## Introduction


## Installation

1. Just clone the repository : `git clone git://github.com/krtek4/fuel-opengraph.git`
2. Copy the content to the package directory (`fuel/packages/`)
3. Edit your application configuration file to add the opengraph package in `fuel/app/config/config.php`

You're all set !

If you want to configure the package, edit the config file directly in the package directory or copy it to your application configuration directory first.

## Usage


## Configuration

All the various options of the config file are commented. It something isn't clear enough, contact me and I will update the description !
